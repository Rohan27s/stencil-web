## Some Important Terminologies
### Molecules
A molecule is a compound component made up of various atoms. It represents a more intricate UI element designed to fulfill a specific function within an application's interface. For example, a JSON to Table or an OTP (One-Time Password) Input Molecule, each composed of multiple atoms to provide a comprehensive and functional unit.

All molecules currently supported can be viewed on this [website](https://stencil-ui-templates.vercel.app/).

 

## Usage 

To get started with Stencil-UI, you can use the hosted version of the product to check all the available molecules. You can get started immediately at [stencil-ui-templates](https://stencil-ui-templates.vercel.app/). The [website](https://stencil-ui-templates.vercel.app) provides an overview of the application, and additional information on the product and guides can be found in the [docs](https://stencil-docs.vercel.app/).


## Development
 Pre-requisites

To start development on Stencil UI, make sure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or later)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Running Stencil UI

> **Note**
> It is also possible to start development with GitHub Codespaces. When navigating to `< > Code`, select `Codespaces` instead of `Local`. Click on either the `+` sign or the `Create codespace on master` button.

Stencil UI uses a monorepo architecture - powered by [Turbo Repo](https://turbo.build/repo) - where multiple applications and libraries exist in a single repository. To set up a local development environment, follow these steps:

**BEFORE** you run the following steps, make sure:
1. You have TypeScript installed locally on your machine: `npm install -g typescript`
2. You are using a supported Node.js version (check `engines` `node` in the [package.json](./package.json))
3. You are using a supported npm version (check `engines` `npm` in the [package.json](./package.json))

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/SamagraX-Stencil/stencil-web && cd stencil-web && yarn install
```

2. To start developing, run one or more of the applications available under `dev` scripts of the package.json.

```bash
yarn install
```

3. To start the local development

- first, create a build of all packages using

```bash
turbo build
```

- now start the project

```bash
turbo dev
```
> **Note**
>   The above command will start all bot-app/ and all-molecule-example/ on the 7001 and 3001 ports respectively

The development environment should now be set up.Happy hacking! ðŸ‘¾
