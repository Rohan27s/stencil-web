## Some Important Terminologies
### Molecules
A molecule is a compound component made up of various atoms. It represents a more intricate UI element designed to fulfill a specific function within an application's interface. For example, a JSON to Table or an OTP (One-Time Password) Input Molecule, each composed of multiple atoms to provide a comprehensive and functional unit.

All molecules currently supported can be viewed on this  [website](https://stencil-ui-templates.vercel.app/)
 

## Usage 

To get started with Stencil-UI, the hosted version of the product can be used to check what all the avaiable molecules. You can get started immediately at [stencil-ui-templates](https://stencil-ui-templates.vercel.app/).   The [website]( https://stencil-ui-templates.vercel.app) provides an overview of the application, additional information on the product and guides can be found in the [docs](https://stencil-docs.vercel.app/).

## Development

 

 
Pre-requisites
 
To be able to start development on StencilUI, make sure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

Running Amplication
</summary> <br />

> **Note**
> It is also possible to start development with GitHub Codespaces, when navigating to `< > Code`, select `Codespaces` instead of `Local`. Click on either the `+`-sign or the `Create codespace on master`-button.

Amplication is using a monorepo architecture - powered by <a href="https://nx.dev">Nx Workspaces</a> - where multiple applications and libraries exist in a single repository. To setup a local development environment the following steps can be followed:

**BEFORE** you run the following steps make sure:
1. You have typescript installed locally on you machine ```npm install -g typescript```
2. You are using a supported node version (check `engines` `node` in the [package.json](./package.json))
3. You are using a supported npm version (check `engines` `npm` in the [package.json](./package.json))
4. You have `docker` installed and running on your machine


1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/amplication/amplication.git && cd amplication && npm install
```

2. Run the setup script, which takes care of installing dependencies, building packages, and setting up the workspace:
```shell
npm run setup:dev
```

3. Option 1: Running the required infrastructure - view infrastructure component logs


```shell
npm run docker:dev
```
3. Option 2: Running the required infrastructure - run the infrastructure components in background
```shell
npm run docker:dev -- -d
```

4. Apply database migrations
```shell
npm run db:migrate:deploy
```

5. To start developing, run one or more of the applications available under `serve:[application]` scripts of the package.json.

```shell
# running the server component
npm run serve:server

# running the client component
npm run serve:client

# running the data-service-generator component
npm run serve:dsg

# running the git-sync-manager component
npm run serve:git

# running the plugin-api component
npm run serve:plugins
```

> **Note**
> In order to run the Amplication client properly, both the client and server need to be started by the `npm run serve:[application]` command, as well as an additional component for development on a specific component.

The development environment should now be set up. Additional information on the different application components can be found under packages/`[application]`/README.md file. Happy hacking! ðŸ‘¾
