## Some Important Terminologies
### Molecules
A molecule is a compound component made up of various atoms. It represents a more intricate UI element designed to fulfill a specific function within an application's interface. For example, a JSON to Table or an OTP (One-Time Password) Input Molecule, each composed of multiple atoms to provide a comprehensive and functional unit.

All molecules currently supported can be viewed on this  [website](https://stencil-ui-templates.vercel.app/)
 

## Usage 

To get started with Stencil-UI, the hosted version of the product can be used to check what all the available molecules. You can get started immediately at [stencil-ui-templates](https://stencil-ui-templates.vercel.app/).   The [website]( https://stencil-ui-templates.vercel.app) provides an overview of the application, and additional information on the product and guides can be found in the [docs](https://stencil-docs.vercel.app/).

## Development
Pre-requisites
 
To be able to start development on StencilUI, make sure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

###
- Node.js
- Git
 
### Running Stencil UI

> **Note**
> It is also possible to start development with GitHub Codespaces, when navigating to `< > Code`, select `Codespaces` instead of `Local`. Click on either the `+`-sign or the `Create codespace on master`-button.

Stencil UI uses a mono repo architecture - powered by <a href="https://turbo.build/repo">Turbo Repo</a> - where multiple applications and libraries exist in a single repository. To setup a local development environment the following steps can be followed:

**BEFORE** you run the following steps make sure:
1. You have typescript installed locally on you machine ```npm install -g typescript```
2. You are using a supported node version (check `engines` `node` in the [package.json](./package.json))
3. You are using a supported npm version (check `engines` `npm` in the [package.json](./package.json))
 

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```shell
git clone  https://github.com/SamagraX-Stencil/stencil-web && cd stencil-web && npm install or yarn install
```

2. To start developing, run one or more of the applications available under `dev` scripts of the package.json.

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. To start the local development

- first, create a build of all packages using

```bash
turbo build
```

- now start the project

```bash
turbo dev
```



> **Note**
>   The above command will start all bot-app/ and all-molecule-example/ on the 7001 and 3001 ports respectively

The development environment should now be set up. Additional information on the different application components can be found under packages/`[application]`/README.md file. Happy hacking! ðŸ‘¾
