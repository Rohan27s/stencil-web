## Introduction

This monorepo is set up to manage multiple projects and packages efficiently. By consolidating projects into a single repository, we can share common configurations, scripts, and dependencies, making the development process more streamlined and cohesive.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
stencil-ui/
stencil-ui/
├── packages/
│   ├── molecules/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── config-manager/
│   ├── chatui/
│   ├── hooks/
│   └── provider/
├── apps/
│   ├── all-molecule-example/
│   └── bot-app/
├── node_modules/
├── package.json
├── turbo.json
└── README.md


```

- `packages/`: Contains shared libraries and modules.
- `apps/`: Contains the different applications.
- `node_modules/`: Automatically generated directory containing installed dependencies.
- `package.json`: Contains metadata about the project and dependencies.
- `turbo.json`: Configuration file for Turborepo.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or later)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SamagraX-Stencil/stencil-web.git
   cd stencil-web
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. To start the local development

- first create build of all packages using

```
turbo build
```

- now start the project

```bash
turbo dev
```

- above command will start all bot-app/ and all-molecule-example/ on the 7001 and 3001 port respectively

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
6. Open a pull request.

Please ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards and passes all tests before submitting a pull request.
 We expect all the code to come with their test cases using React Testing Library. Attach the build pass code and the test pass with the PR 

## Creation of Molecule

There are multiple molecules present in the packages folder which houses the building blocks for our application.

Checkout the project and it's structure from there and you can start the implementation for it.
All the molecules are in the packages folder.
